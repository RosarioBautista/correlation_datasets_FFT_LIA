# Correlation datasets FFT and LIA

## This repository contains the vibration amplitudes for each of the bearing fault frequencies, for both, FFT and LIA.
The excel file "correlation_datasets.xlsx" contains 4 sheets, for each of the fault frequencies BPFI, BPFO, BSF and TFT. The conditions measured in each sheet are Fault-Free, seeded faults after one day of operation (Test 1) and seeded faults after two day of operation (Test 2).
